The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if there are spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` function, the calculation may not work as expected. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` will work correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 20 px)` will likely fail because there is a space between `-` and `20px`. Another example is using `calc(100vh - 100px)` vs `calc(100vh - 100 px)`, the first one works but the second one does not.
